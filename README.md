# InLine

InLine is a social network (currently only for iOS) that allows users to categorize the different relationships in their life through the user of branches. There are six branches (<span style="color: yellow">Fun</span>, <span style="color: blue">Friends & Family</span>, <span style="color: green">Work Life</span>, <span style="color: orange">Food & Fitness</span>, <span style="color: red">Love</span>, <span style="color: purple">Mind & Spirit</span>), and when accepting follower requests you can categorize the user into the different branches restricting theri access. This allows for a less intrusive social experience and allows users to have deeper control over their social activity.
